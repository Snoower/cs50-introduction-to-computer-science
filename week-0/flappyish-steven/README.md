# Flappyish Steven
  ### Scratch Link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/966960817/
  
  ### Description:
  I decided to make a video game inspired by the TV show "Steven Universe" and the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird". The main control is space bar, which allows Steven to "flap". 
  You start with 5 lives and after that losing all of your lives, the game is over. 
  The objective is to 1) collect Cookie Cats and Gems, which can provide points and lives 2) avoid the Gem Rejuvenator (Scythe), which takes one life.
